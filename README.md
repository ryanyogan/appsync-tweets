# App Sync Tweets

---

Just playing around with Serverless and App Sync for an upcoming talk, this particular repo is focused on using AWS AppSync && AWS Lambda's from SLS, later we will put users in Dynamo, etc... Eventually we will have a nice full stack app using many of the AWS "more fun, newer" toys :)
